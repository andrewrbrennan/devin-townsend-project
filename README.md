# [Devin Townsend Project](https://andrewrbrennan.github.io/devin-townsend-project/)

A website for my personal favourite musician.

# About

I was struggling to find a topic that appealed to me for this project. I floated a fair few ideas around in my head before deciding on this one. I felt that since it was something I cared about, I would be able to put much more effort into it. I tried not to take any inspiration from the actual site that exists for his music. The only real inspiration I took was using an underscore in his name for the header. I wanted to make sure that if somoen had never heard of him before, this small site would have enough infor to tell you what he's all about and provide a selection of music for potential newcomers to check out

# UI/UX Aims

Since the music is of the heavier sort, I figured I would go with a tried and tested colour scheme of red & black. The colour play well off one another and look great on screen. I used the Montserrat font for the site as I felt that it suited the look and general feel of the site. 

On the main page the goal was to show some general info so I have the upcoming tourdates and a bit of recent news to show what he's been up to. The about page is a short bio of his career so far so a usewr can easily get up to speed on the artist. I put a good bit of effort into making the music page well rounded and has a faior bit of content for a user to access. It has an embedded music video along with links to the albums that have been released under the Devin Townsend moniker. However since he has been in a number of bands over the years I opted for linking two of his most famous ones with embedded spotify playlists at the bottom of the page. The signup page functions as a newsletter that will inform you of any future tours that get announced. 

I feel like the site reaches the goal of letting the user access the content they want in as few sections as possible.

I feel that I achieved most of what my intent was with the wireframes, they were put together with the help of my mentor. Admittedly in the future I will spend more time on them before beginning a project.

# Website Sections & Features

### Home

The first thing the user is greeted with is a large picture of Devin Townsend doing what he does best, screaming into the microphone. I aimed to have thsi picture or at least a version of it be used across all devices which necessitated me cropping it and saving various versions of it. I briefly thought about using a different image on each responsive version of the site, bit opted to stick for the one I used on the desktop version for site parity. Below this image are some columns containing the upcoming tour dates and
